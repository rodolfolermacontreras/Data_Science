    "Your next generation search engine startup was successful in having the ability to search for images based on their content. As a result, the startup received its second round of funding to be able to search news articles based on their topic. As the lead data scientist, you are tasked to build a model that classifies the topic of each article or newswire. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, you will leverage the RNN_KERAS.ipynb lab in the lesson. You are tasked to use the Keras Reuters newswire topics classification dataset. This dataset contains 11,228 newswires from Reuters, labeled with over 46 topics. Each wire is encoded as a sequence of word indexes. For convenience, words are indexed by overall frequency in the dataset, so that for instance the integer \"3\" encodes the 3rd most frequent word in the data. This allows for quick filtering operations such as: \"only consider the top 10,000 most common words, but eliminate the top 20 most common words\". As a convention, \"0\" does not stand for a specific word, but instead is used to encode any unknown word.\n",

    "- It is possible to see that this artificial recurrent neural network (RNN) -> **Long short term memory** has a particularly great effect on the accuracy of this classification model, given by the fact that unlike standard feed forward neural networks, LSTM has feedback connections. It cannot only process single data points (such as images), but also entire sequences of data. The advantage of is clearly seen after using a standard deep neuron network model and see that the accuracy did not change from epoch to epoch.\n",

    "- As discussed during the class tuning the hyperparameters and choosing the right was mentioned to be a *dark art* and it is possible to see why in this example. Even though choosing the right hyperparameters is critical, besides some state of the art methods that are being developed right now, the best approach would be to talk to experts on the problem you are working on and on the Deep learning algorithm that is being used and do some try and error testing different scenarios.\n",

    "- Another thing that is possible to see (again) is that working on this specialized Deep Learning algorithms requires some knowledge of the kind of problem that we are working on as well as a very good understanding of the data available and the prediction that is wanted. Therefore working with the subject expert matter is a critical thing all the way thru a ML project.\n",

Which makes clear that it is important to work with experts all the way thru the ML project and explore different options."
