    "\n",
    "- The **bag of words model** is a simple widely used and surprisingly effective model for analysis of text data. The BOW model uses only on the frequency of the words in the document and order of the words is not considered. Despite these seemingly ridiculous assumptions, the model works well in many cases. \n",
    "  - The BOW model assumes **exchangeability** of words. \n",
    "  - The end product of applying the BOW model is a term-document or document-term matrix. The tdm, or dtm is a structured representation of word frequency by document. \n",
    "  - The tdm or dtm can be used for classification if labels are available or clustering for unsupervised learning. \n",
    "- Other powerful models are the **word to vec** and **doc to vec** models. Word to vec, uses a neural network model to determine similarity between words. These models are beyond the scope of this tutorial. You can find a good introduction to this model in the [article by Rong](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.2738.pdf)\n",
    "- Another widely used model is of **Part of Speech (PoS) Tagging**. PoS tagging attempts to label or annotate words in a corpus (e.g. a collection of documents) as, say nouns, verbs, pronouns, etc. PoS tagging is beyond the  scope of this tutorial. The PoS tagger creates a tree of the relationship of words in say a sentence. One useful specialization of PoS tagging is named entity recognition, which attempts to find proper nouns. \n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    " - Lowercase the text.\n",
    " - Remove symbols and/or punctuation.\n",
    " - Remove numbers. May also replace all numbers with a numeric tag, for example `<NUM>` or similar. We may also consider replacing all dates with `<DATE>` or similarly use tags `<URL>`, `<PHONE>`, `<EMAIL>`, etc...\n",
    " - Strip extra white space. White space has many forms: space, newline, or tab. There are also other rarely used unicode specifications for other white space characters.\n",
    " - Remove all non-printable unicode characters.\n",
    " - Replace accent characters (For example: N̈ --> N).\n",
    " - Remove 'stop words'. Stop words are generally non-informative words like 'the, as, a, ours, etc...'\n",
    " - Stem words to similar endings. (For example: 'statistics', 'statistical', 'statistic' --> 'statisti')\n",
    " - Create bi-grams (or tri-grams, or N-grams, ...). (For example, 'out of date' --> 'out-of-date' or 'out_of_date')\n",
    " \n",
    "There are a few reasons to clean your text.  The primary reason is to reduce the potential vocabulary and increase the observations of specific words (or tokens).  When considering which of the above steps to apply in your text analysis or NLP project, consider how you want the problem at hand to treat different instances of tokens.  Ask yourself questions like \"Do I want to consider the words 'China' and 'china' to be different?\" In the prior example one is a country and the other is a plate. Or maybe numbers are important in our text. The answers to these questions determine which pre-processing steps to perform and is very problem specific.\n",

If we are interested in finding important words, we must look for words in between 'aaaaa' and 'a' in usage.\n",

    "The IDF can exhibit a problem however. When there are a few documents with very frequent terms, the weighting is skewed toward those documents.  To solve this problem, we reweight IDF by the overall frequency of the word to create a **term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF)** matrix. The formula for computing TFIDF is: \n",
